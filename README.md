# ODT-SAS
ODT-SAS is a new semi-automatic method that uses conventional approaches (not based on machine learning) to process optical diffraction tomography (ODT) images of biological cells. It enables 3D segmentation of whole biological cells and 2 types of their organelles: nucleolus and lipid structures.
